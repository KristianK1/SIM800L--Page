		<h2>SIM800L library for ESP32</h2>

			This is a library for http-get visit for SIM800L.
			The code is intended for ESP32, which means that it uses Serial2 port
			instead of Serial or SoftwareSerial
			<br>
			First you make an object of type SIM800L_S2.
			<br>
			Then you set a link with a
			function setLink(string), it can only visit http links.
			<br>
			<br>
			Then call the function access() until you get a
			return value of 3.
			<br>
			<br>
			In my project a ThingsMobile SIM card was used, which I recomend.

			Because of that I used "TM" for APN name, you can change it in line 54.
